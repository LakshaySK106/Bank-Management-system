# Bank-Management-system
Here is a project developed as a mini project in the C bank management system during my first semester; it is complete , totally error-free and runtime encrypted. This project is focused on customer account services in banks, so it is named “Bank Management System”. Here, you can create a new account, update information of an existing account, view and manage transactions, check the details of an existing account, remove existing account and view customers’ list, etc.
